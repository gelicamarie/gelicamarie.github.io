title: About Section
---

I am a programmer currently on my 2nd year of Computer Science at Carleton University in Canada.

Still finding my footing in the vast world of Programming and so I always

keep an open mind when it comes to learning new things.

I absolutely love problem solving which was what gravitated me towards this field.

I also love being creative and seeing my ideas come to life.

On my free time, when I am not thinking of solutions for some bug, I spend my time drawing and contemplating the
meaning of life
